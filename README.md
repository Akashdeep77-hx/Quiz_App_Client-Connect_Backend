Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and dependencies so you have full control over them.
